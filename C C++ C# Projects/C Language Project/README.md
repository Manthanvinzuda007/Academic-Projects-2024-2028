📖 Overview

A comprehensive collection of C language projects demonstrating a journey from fundamental syntax to advanced systems programming, data structures, and networking. This repository serves as a technical showcase of low-level programming mastery and algorithmic efficiency.

📂 Project Directory

This repository contains various implementations categorized by their technical complexity and functional domain.

🌐 Networking & Concurrency

Expert Level: Focus on low-level system communication and thread safety.

TCP Multi Client Server.c 📡

A robust socket programming implementation using the Berkeley Sockets API.

Features a server architecture capable of handling multiple concurrent client connections.

Multithreaded Thread Pool.c 🧵

An advanced system utility that manages a pool of worker threads.

Implements task queuing to reduce overhead for high-frequency execution.

🌳 Data Structures & Algorithms

Advanced: Focus on memory efficiency and logarithmic time complexity.

SELF-BALANCING AVL TREE.c ⚖️

A sophisticated implementation of an AVL tree.

Maintains strictly balanced height through rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL) for $O(\log n)$ performance.

Binary Search Tree.c 🌿

Core BST logic featuring recursive and iterative node manipulation.

Includes complex deletion cases and all DFS traversal methods.

🗄️ Systems & Utilities

Tooling: Focus on logic and persistent data management.

File Student MGT.c 📁

A CRUD-based management system demonstrating persistent storage.

Utilizes binary/text file streams for data integrity.

Full Calculator.c / Calculate in C.c 🔢

Terminal-based utilities handling arithmetic operations and input validation.

🐣 Foundations & Logic

Basics: Focus on fundamental algorithmic thinking.

Pattern.c / Pattern 1.c / Pattern 2.c 💠

Exercises in nested loops and visual coordinate mapping.

Hello world.c 👋

The classic entry point into the C environment.

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

🔧 Skill

📝 Description

Memory Management

Expert usage of malloc, calloc, realloc, and free to ensure zero memory leaks.

Concurrency

Implementation of POSIX threads (pthreads), mutex locks, and condition variables.

Networking

Deep understanding of the OSI model, TCP/IP stack, and the C Socket API.

File Systems

Direct manipulation of binary/text streams for persistent application state.

Algorithm Design

Practical application of Big O notation and self-correcting data structures.

🚀 Getting Started

📋 Prerequisites

To compile these projects, you need a C compiler installed on your system:

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Clang

Make (Optional but recommended for larger builds)

🏗️ Compilation & Execution

For standard projects:

gcc "FileName.c" -o output
./output


For multithreaded/networked projects:

gcc "Multithreaded Thread Pool.c" -o threadpool -lpthread
./threadpool


📈 Roadmap

[x] Phase 1: Fundamental Syntax & Logic Building

[x] Phase 2: Advanced Data Structures (Self-balancing Trees)

[x] Phase 3: System Persistence (File I/O)

[x] Phase 4: Network Programming (TCP/IP)

[ ] Phase 5: Custom Memory Allocator (Malloc implementation)

[ ] Phase 6: Integration with Graphics Libraries (Raylib/SDL)
